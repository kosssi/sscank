Sscank is a fork of [KNASS](https://github.com/raphaelgoetter/KNACSS).

I love the concept but i don't like how it is writing...

Todo list :
- [x] Copy all KNACSS composent
- [ ] Refactoring off all LESS
- [ ] Create composer.json
- [ ] Create bower.json
- [ ] Create component.json
- [ ] Build less to CSS
- [ ] Create minify CSS
- [ ] Add test for CSS files
